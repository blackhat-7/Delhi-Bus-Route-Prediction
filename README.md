Ubiquity of Internet and digitization of transportation managementsystems have resulted into generation of various types of Geo-spatial datathat can be utilized for different purposes. One such usage is Automatic ticketing system wherein a passenger can buy a ticket online in real timethrough her mobile just by scanning a QR code fixed on passenger seats. However, logistic optimizations in public transports often schedule a par-ticular bus to ply on different routes at different times of the day, especially in developing countries. But the change in the route of a bus brings inother logistics issues, such as assigning new bus route to a bus in the sys-tem, change in ticketing prices as per the new route, and informing thenew route to the passengers to not cause any inconvenience to passengerswhile  buying tickets or at the display panel of the bus. Till now there does not exist any study that assists in route identification of a bus basedon its recent trajectory. This paper presents the problem of the route pre-diction of a bus based on its recent trajectory and prepare a benchmark dataset to evaluate route prediction algorithms. Our current prediction model achieves an accuracy of 85%.
